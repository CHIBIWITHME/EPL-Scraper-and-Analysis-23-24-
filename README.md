This project scrapes and analyzes English Premier League (EPL) data for the 2023–2024 season. It includes player and team statistics such as match results, shooting stats, and performance metrics. The goal is to extract insights from real-world football data using web scraping and data analysis tools.

## **Problem Statement**  
Football is an unpredictable sport, but data-driven analysis can uncover patterns and insights that help in understanding team performance, referee influence, and match dynamics. This project aims to analyze key football metrics, offering insights into team efficiency, defensive solidity, and referee impact.
